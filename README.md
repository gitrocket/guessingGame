This is a guessing game where a player is given a blurred picture and asked to guess what it is. After making a guess, the player clicks on the blurred image to invoke an unblurred version of the picture. Designing the game allows for a good introduction to event handling.

Concepts covered in creating the game: CSS grid; asynchronous coding; handling the page load event by assigning a function to the window.onload event so that the function will be invoked when the page is loaded; assigning a single event handler to multiple elements' onclick property; the event object and target.
